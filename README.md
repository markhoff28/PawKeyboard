# 🐾 PawKeyboard

*A cute paw-key that types `x3`, `owo` and more – for furries, by furries. One button, infinite fluff chat.*

## ✨ What is this?

**PawKeyboard** is a single-button USB device with a paw-shaped keycap that sends predefined ASCII emotes like `owo`, `x3`, `rawr~`, or `*paw*` – directly into your text field.  
It’s powered by an Arduino Pro Micro, fits into a tiny 3D-printable case, and adds just the right amount of fluff to your daily typing.

This is not just a button. It’s a portal into the fluffy side of the internet.
